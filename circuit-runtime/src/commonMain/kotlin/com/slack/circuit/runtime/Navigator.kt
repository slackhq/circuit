   * Clear the existing backstack of [screens][Screen] and navigate to [newRoot].
   *
   * This is useful in preventing the user from returning to a completed workflow, such as a
   * tutorial, wizard, or authentication flow.
   *
   * Example
   *
   * ```kotlin
   * val navigator = Navigator()
   * navigator.push(LoginScreen1)
   * navigator.push(LoginScreen2)
   *
   * // Login flow is complete. Wipe backstack and set new root screen
   * val loginScreens = navigator.resetRoot(HomeScreen)
   * ```
   *
   * ## Multiple back stacks
   *
   * The [saveState] and [restoreState] parameters enable functionality what is commonly called
   * 'multiple back stacks'. By optionally saving, and later restoring the back stack, you can
   * enable different root screens to have their own back stacks. A common use case is with the
   * bottom navigation bar UX pattern.
   *
   * ```kotlin
   * navigator.resetRoot(HomeNavTab1, saveState = true, restoreState = true)
   * // User navigates to a details screen
   * navigator.push(EntityDetails(id = foo))
   * // Later, user clicks on a bottom navigation item
   * navigator.resetRoot(HomeNavTab2, saveState = true, restoreState = true)
   * // Later, user switches back to the first navigation item
   * navigator.resetRoot(HomeNavTab1, saveState = true, restoreState = true)
   * // The existing back stack is restored, and EntityDetails(id = foo) will be top of
   * // the back stack
   * ```
   *
   * There are times when saving and restoring the back stack may not be appropriate, so use this
   * feature only when it makes sense. A common example where it probably does not make sense is
   * launching screens which define a UX flow which has a defined completion, such as onboarding.
   *
   * @param newRoot The new root [Screen]
   * @param saveState Whether to save the current entry list. It can be restored by passing the
   *   current root [Screen] to [resetRoot] with `restoreState = true`
   * @param restoreState Whether any previously saved state for the given [newRoot] should be
   *   restored. If this is `false` or there is no previous state, the back stack will only contain
   *   [newRoot].
