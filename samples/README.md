=======

This directory contains a collection of samples that demonstrate how to use Circuit in different
contexts.

See the README.md files in each sample directory for more information.

- `star` – A non-trivial multiplatform app for Social Tees Animal Rescue (STAR) that demonstrates how to
  use Circuit in a real-world app. Contains lots of cute dogs.

  decrements a count.

  Counter example.
