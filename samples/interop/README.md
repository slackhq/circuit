Interop
=======

A set of examples of interop from different paradigms into Circuit using a simple Counter example.

**Presenter examples**
- Circuit
- Kotlin `Flow`
- RxJava
- Simple (no framework, just simple callbacks)

**UI examples**
- Circuit/Compose
- Android `View`

Different UIs and different presenters can be paired together to interop to Circuit and run
together. All of these examples interop _to_ Circuit, but not _from_ Circuit (yet).
