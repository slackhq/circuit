Samples
=======

This directory contains a collection of samples that demonstrate how to use Circuit in different
contexts.

See the README.md files in each sample directory for more information.

- `star` – A non-trivial multiplatform app for Social Tees Animal Rescue (STAR) that demonstrates how to
  use Circuit in a real-world app. Contains lots of cute dogs.
- `counter` – A multiplatform counter circuit. This circuit is a simple counter that increments or
  decrements a count.
- `interop` - A set of examples of interop from different paradigms into Circuit using a simple
  Counter example.
- `tacos` - A food ordering flow/wizard app demonstrating use of a composite Circuit presenter and
  multiple nested UIs.
- `tutorial` - A tutorial that walks through the creation of a simple Circuit app. Follow the
  instructions [here](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/tutorial/).
  - Run the Desktop app via `./gradlew :samples:tutorial:run`.
  - Install the Android app via `./gradlew :samples:tutorial:installDebug`.
