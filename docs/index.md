⚡️ Circuit

🚧 **Under construction** 🚧

This project is very much a work in progress and far from finished!

## Overview

Circuit is a simple, lightweight, and extensible framework for building Kotlin applications that's Compose from the ground up.

!!! info "Compose Runtime vs. Compose UI"
    Compose itself is essentially two libraries – Compose Compiler and Compose UI. Most folks usually think of Compose UI, but the compiler (and associated runtime) are actually not specific to UI at all and offer powerful state management APIs.
    
    Jake Wharton has an excellent post about this: https://jakewharton.com/a-jetpack-compose-by-any-other-name/

It builds upon core principles we already know like Presenters and UDF, and adds native support in its framework for all the other requirements we set out for above. It’s heavily influenced by Cash App’s Broadway architecture ([talked about at Droidcon NYC](https://www.droidcon.com/2022/09/29/architecture-at-scale/), also very derived from our conversations with them).

Circuit’s core components are its `Presenter` and `Ui` interfaces.

1. A `Presenter` and a `Ui` cannot directly access each other. They can only communicate through state and event emissions.
2. UIs are compose-first.
3. Presenters are _also_ compose-first. They do not emit Compose UI, but they do use the Compose runtime to manage and emit state.
4. Both `Presenter` and `Ui` each have a single composable function.
5. In most cases, Circuit automatically connects presenters and UIs.
6. `Presenter` and `Ui` are both generic types, with generics to define the `UiState` types they communicate with.
7. They are keyed by `Screen`s. One runs a new `Presenter`/`Ui` pairing by requesting them with a given `Screen` that they understand.

!!! note "Circuits"
    The pairing of a `Presenter` and `Ui` for a given `Screen` key is what we semantically call a “circuit”.
    
    * Your application is composed of “circuits”.
    * A simple counter `Presenter` + `Ui` pairing would be a “counter circuit”.
    * Nested presenter/UIs would be “nested circuits” or “sub circuits”
    * Composite presenter/UIs would be “composite circuits”
    * etc etc.

Circuit’s repo (https://github.com/slackhq/circuit) is being actively developed in the open, which allows us to continue collaborating with external folks too. We have a trivial-but-not-too-trivial sample app that we have been developing in it to serve as a demo for a number of common patterns in Circuit use.

## Counter Example

This is a very simple case of a Counter circuit that displays the count and has buttons to increment and decrement.

There’s some glue code missing from this example that's covered in the Code Gen (TODO link) section later.

```kotlin
@Parcelize
object CounterScreen : Screen {
  data class CounterState(
    val count: Int,
    val eventSink: (CounterEvent) -> Unit,
  ) : CircuitUiState
  sealed interface CounterEvent : CircuitUiEvent {
    object Increment : CounterEvent
    object Decrement : CounterEvent
  }
}

@CircuitPresenter(CounterScreen::class, AppScope::class)
@Composable
fun CounterPresenter(): CounterState {
  var count by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(0) }

  return CounterState(count) { event ->
    when (event) {
      is CounterEvent.Increment -> count++
      is CounterEvent.Decrement -> count--
    }
  }
}

@CircuitInject(CounterScreen::class, AppScope::class)
@Composable
fun Counter(state: CounterState) {
  Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
    Column(Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)) {
      Text(
        modifier = Modifier.align(CenterHorizontally),
        text = "Count: ${state.count}",
        style = MaterialTheme.typography.displayLarge
      )
      Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))
      val eventSink = state.eventSink
      Button(
        modifier = Modifier.align(CenterHorizontally),
        onClick = { eventSink(CounterEvent.Increment) }
      ) { Icon(rememberVectorPainter(Icons.Filled.Add), "Increment") }
      Button(
        modifier = Modifier.align(CenterHorizontally),
        onClick = { eventSink(CounterEvent.Decrement) }
      ) { Icon(rememberVectorPainter(Icons.Filled.Remove), "Decrement") }
    }
  }
}
```
