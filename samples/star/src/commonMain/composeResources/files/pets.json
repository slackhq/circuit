      "description": "Holiday - 6 months & 15lbs (as of 12/11), Terrier/Pom Mix, Spayed Expected full grown size 25lbs Our Team Says: Holiday needs a home in the burbs ideally or in a calm part of the city with another pup - to help with her confidence outside. She's a super sweet girl just not a big fan of the city! This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Their Foster Parent Says: \" Their foster parent says that Holiday (Holly) is the sweetest pup. She is timid at first and jumpy with new/loud noises, but as she is warming up, we have been able to see her playful side emerge. Holly is a respectful playmate to the two resident kittens and enjoys their company. Holly is an A+ cuddler and loves receiving pets and kisses. She is still fearful of walks, as the noises and people outside overwhelm her. She will stop walking and start shaking or try to hide, needs a home outside of the city. Inside the apartment, she is comfortable and loves to jump around and play with squeaky toys. Holly will make the sweetest companion and play mate to her future forever family.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) TOLERANCE TO CITY Country mouse – Needs a home outside of the city, suburbs or beyond. Terrified of walks, barely wants to move and shakes a lot, eager to get back home (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue). POTTY TRAINING Not yet – Needs some time and training, goes to the bathroom on pee pads about 85% of the time COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Wallflower – Very shy with new people and takes a while to warm up. Afraid when unfamiliar people try to say hi on the street, hides or shrinks back when new people visit the home. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Maybe for age 12 and up – Is either big and energetic (okay with kids big enough not to get knocked down) or a little skittish (could be comfortable with older children that can be extra gentle) SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Still working on it – Either retreats from other dogs or barks at them/leash reactive. Needs more socialization training or may just be a dog that prefers human company RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Yes – Seems to get along with cats etc., either tries to play with them or is mostly uninterested MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Needs training – Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained. Tries to put their mouth on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs leash, chews on your personal belongings SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Past this stage – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or exhibit destructive behavior when you leave the apartment or house. LEASH MANNERS WTF is a leash – Pulls hard. Zig zags like crazy. Has no idea how to walk on a leash or doesn’t have outside privileges yet (too young) CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Listens to correction – Only jumps on people they know when really excited, stops with correction. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate at night and are working on it when we leave her alone. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon HOW DID THIS DOG END UP WITH US? Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

      "description": "Dante - 10 months & 45lbs (as of 8/12), Cattle Dog & Spaniel Mix, Neutered Expected to be about 50lbs full grown - once he gets some weight and muscle onto him Our Team Says: Dante grew up in boarding/a shelter setting since he was 8 weeks old so he's a bit shy. Due to this he needs a home in a calm area, the burbs would be ideal. Our dream home for him would also have a dog in it so he can learn how to dog :) Dante has come a LONG way. He found a foster home in the burbs and is such a sweet and silly boy!! We are hoping someone loves him as much as we all do on our team! Thier Foster Parent Says: \"Dante has been pure joy. Within a few hours of arriving home, he was learning to play fetch and running like a maniac in the backyard. He truly loves doing laps. While he hasn't exhibited any separation anxiety, he is definitely my shadow when I am home. He follows me everywhere. He sits at my feet or pressed against me on the couch. He's like a gangly teenager who has no concept of his size. He crams himself anywhere to sit beside me. He has definitely improved on the leash and only pulls minimally. However, he hasn't completely grasped that walks are for potty business. So far the only place he is completely comfortable doing his business is in the backyard. He's also still very shy around men. If my husband walks out of the house 8 times a day, Dante barks upon his return 8 times. He just barks, nothing more though and is fine inside just forgets who he is when he comes home. It's actually kind of cute. He loves his toys, ice cubes and carrots. He has definitely picked up the latter two from my other dogs. He is wonderful and fits right in.He's gentle and funny and silly.\" Cuddle Bug Level High -- Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time - Dante leans toward the high level. He just wants to be near his human when they are home. He's a little big for a lap dog but he's usually attached to me in some way. His head is often resting on my legs or feet. Potty Trained Yes -- Few or no accidents - I am truly impressed at how well Dante is doing. He has only one minor accident in the house and I actually think he got over excited by men working outside. The small trail was as if he was running. Otherwise, he does his business in the backyard with no issues. He wakes up between 6 and 7 am and we go right outside. He pees on cue. Lately, he stands by the back door when he has to pee. Comfy with strangers? Quite the wallflower, very shy with new people and takes a while to warm up. Afraid when unfamiliar people try to say hi on the street, hides or shrinks back when new people visit the home. - Dante is still a scaredy cat especially around men. I don't know if it's their size or deep voices but he doesn't love them. After the initial barking he pretty much just stays close to me. Comfortable with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision) Can't tell. Haven't been around any children. Yes for 12 and up -- may be a little energetic or a little skittish, best with older children that can be extra gentle or that are big enough not to get accidentally knocked down Social with Other Dogs? Yes -- Good with all other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines - He definitely enjoys my other dogs thought my little guy is still a bit hesitant around him. He just wants to play. Great with other dogs!! - Fine with all sizes and ages. Very gentle. Respectful of Other Animals? (cats, small pets, etc.) Yes - fine to be in a home with cats: he's great with cats :) Mouthy Behavior? Low – Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in its mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime, doesn’t wreck your stuff -- only chews on appropriate things like dog toys and bones. - He is mostly good. In the morning after his first pee, we try to come back to bed for a bit. Then and only then he'll try to gnaw on my sleeper or the edge of the bed. I think he's just restless and wants to play and I want a couple more minutes of sleep. He responds well to correction. Leash Manners? Getting the Hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in its life but he/she is figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. - He's definitely making progress in this regard. He likes to sniff which lleads to moderate pulling. Okay in the city? - NO - must have a home in the burbs with a fenced in yard. Jumping on People to Say Hi? Low – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. - The only time I have seen him jump at all are during fetch when I am about to release his toy. He's just eager to retrieve it. . Separation Anxiety? (Please be sure to leave your foster dog home alone every single day for at least 20 minutes.) Low – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or do anything shitty when you leave the apartment or house. Crate training? Not at all – Don’t even have one, I’ve puppy proofed and we free range. Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas.

He is less sure about other dogs, so introductions should be made with caution. Irwin is fully house trained, crate trained, and is not destructive in the home.

He’s an affectionate, playful pup with a great balance of energy and calm: he's always up for a game of tug or fetch, a training session, or a long walk, but also content to chew on a bone or nap while I work. His daily routine includes a long morning walk (70 mins minutes), a shorter one later in the day (45-60 mins), two short potty breaks (15 mins) and plenty of enrichment in between (sniff mat, lick mat, and chew toys). He sleeps soundly through the night in his crate and is fully housetrained (no fuss with potty breaks!). He’s food-motivated and eager to train: he has sit, down, paw, and touch in his repertoire and we’re working on stay and switch now. He has a very cute little prance when he’s happy or curious or following me around doing chores, and he nuzzles in for cuddles throughout the day. We are still working on a few things: he can be jumpy on people and furniture, occasionally mouthy during play, and has some work to do with on-leash behavior.

      "description": "Charlie - 10 months & 50lbs (as of 8/12/25) Pointer Mix Neutered Expected to be about 50lbs Full Grown Our Team Says: Charlie needs a home in the burbs. He REALLY loves other dogs and would do really well in a home with another pup :) This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Thier Foster Parent Says: \"Charlie is an incredibly sweet, loving, funny guy. He loves to play with toys and other dogs, and, like most young dogs his age, likes to pass out after he's exhausted himself from playtime. He also loves to snuggle when he's tired, resting his head on your shoulder while he nestles. He is VERY scared of loud or new noises so he does need help shifting energy when he gets startled like that. Sometimes he barks and does a low-level growl when he hears those unfamiliar noises but he is never aggressive towards others. The only time he really barks is if someone is approaching the house to alert us but then quickly goes to hide if someone new comes inside. He can get a little scared and hide but, as he gets more and more acclimated, he comes out to explore his surroundings. It's very important to instill in him that he is safe and cared for at all times. Once he has decided you are a safe person, he will be your shadow! He's very playful and likes to jump up and sometimes will accidentally scratch but it's never on purpose-he just loves to have fun! He gets up around 7:00 am to go outside and have breakfast and then sometimes will even go back to sleep. Then he likes to play with other dogs (we have 2 others in the house) before taking a nap. We go for walks with Charlie to improve his leash etiquette-he's VERY eager to walk but is still learning how to walk better on the leash! Then we'll have dinner around 6:00 pm with him, he'll do some more romping, and he'll go to bed with us. He is very good about bedtime routine. Once the lights are off he goes to sleep and loves to cuddle up at the end of the bed. Overall, Charlie has been a real joy to have and to take care of. Anyone would be lucky to have him!\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle Bug Level-high Comfy with strangers?- Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. Once he is inside he will shower them with kisses. He just needs to be in his safe space. Good with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision)- Yes for 12 and up -- may be a little energetic or a little skittish, best with older children that can be extra gentle or that are big enough not to get accidentally knocked down Good with Other Dogs?- Yes -- Good with all other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines Mouthy Behavior?- Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained to not be mouthy. Wants to put everything in their mouth. Tries to chew on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs the leash with its mouth, loves to gnaw on your personal belongings. He is easily corrected with a toy. Leash Manners?- Getting the Hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in its life but he is figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. Okay in the city? Sort of -- Spooked easily by loud noises and bustling areas but walks pretty well and probably just needs more time to adjust (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue) Jumping on People to Say Hi?- Medium – Jumps up only on people the dog knows when really excited. Stops with correction. Separation Anxiety? -Low – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or do anything shitty when you leave the apartment or house. Crate training? -Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Thier Foster Parent Says: \"It has been so rewarding watching Cinnamon slowly come out of his shell. It's clear that he did not have much previous socialization with humans, but his spunky little personality has been shining through more and more each day as he gets more comfortable. We've gone from him not letting me get within 3 feet of him, to him now gently asking for pets and attention. He is incredibly curious, following me all around the apartment, and absolutely obsessed with playing with his toys. He is most definitely food motivated, so once he's built up a little more confidence I think it'll be a breeze to start teaching him commands. He has the occasional accident indoors, but has already made such great progress with doing his business outside. With a little bit more time and patience, Cinnamon is going to make the best companion. And let's face it, the underbite is undeniably adorable!!\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Tolerance to City: Adjusting to the city - Definitely still gets spooked by loud noises or crowded areas, but seems to slowly be getting more comfortable. Potty Training: Sort of - Has been doing all of his #2's outside but still uses a pee pad inside from time to time. Comfort Level with Strangers: Wallflower - Again, I think this will improve with time as he gets more confident. Behavior with Children: Yes for most ages - A little hard to tell right now; He can get a little nippy when he plays but it's always pretty gentle. Social Behavior with other Dogs: Yes - okay to live with another dog! Not super intrested in greeting dogs on the street but fine to live with other pups! Respectful Behavior with other Animals: Yes - Again, this is hard to tell, but he seems pretty indifferent when we see squirrels and birds on our walks. Mouthy Behavior: Working on it - Likes to get a little nippy when he plays but is always very gentle. Will occasionally try to grab shoes or other belongings when he's in a rambunctious mood. Separation Anxiety: Past this stage Leash Manners: Getting the hang of it - Happy to trot along right next to you and follow your lead. Doesn't like the sensation of the leash tugging on him though and will resist. Cuddle Bug Level: Lower but moving toward medium Jumping on People to say Hello: Calm greetings - Doesn't jump or get particularly excited Crate Training: Not at all - I don't have a crate and he seems to be fine with free range Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico.

She is NOT a city girl. Burbs and beyond are ideal for her. She would also do great with another dog in the home :) Our Foster Parent Says: \" Loreen is a very sweet girl who still has her puppy moments. She has zoomies, especially when you come home after work of if you were just gone for 2 minutes. She recently discovered her love of toys and gathers each one of them into her bed. Unfortunately she hasn’t quite figured out toy vs non-toy yet but she’s easily redirected. Her bed is her safe space, especially when she’s has her anxious moments. When Loreen initially came to NYC from Tennessee she was very scared being in a city setting and shook for an entire week. She was then relocated to Long Island with me and the quiet environment has really let her true self show. She has slowly warmed up to being outside and now runs around happily in my yard and is learning to enjoy walks. Having another confident dog is definitely a plus! She often looks to my dog Kiba when she gets nervous and even follows him around sometimes. At home she is a cuddle bug and loves to be near you. She politely asks for airlifts onto the bed but occasionally gives a sassy bark or two to get your attention. She does well with baths and brushing, she’s also happy to be dressed! She’s very good with both of my cats and my dog, she’s very neutral around everyone and does not show any signs of guarding issues. She did well around a 3 year old boy and generally does well with everyone, she is occasionally anxious with new people.

Thier Foster Parent Says: \"Currant is a timid, gentle, and incredibly sweet senior dog. During her first few days, she preferred to stay in her crate, quietly observing her new surroundings. With patience, time and some treats, she is trusting and approaching. She enjoys her meal time, hops and follows around while we are preparing her meals. She enjoys short breaks and is looking to run back into her crate once she is done exploring. She did fine when interacting with our two dogs both indoor and outdoor. She’s calm, quiet, and happiest in a peaceful home with minimal disturbances.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: FLEXIBLE: We predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale with regard to exercise and mental stimulation requirements, but seniors tend to need a lot of help and understanding when it comes to lifestyle and veterinary issues. Seniors usually need quiet, calm environments and routines and do not do well with a lot of bustle, change, and rambunctious movement (kids and young playful dogs, for instance). This dog’s adopter will need to be prepared for senior health challenges, which usually come with expensive veterinary bills and time in vet offices. Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless amounts of stimulation and exercise but still needs a few short walks a day (10-30 min each) for potty breaks and to stretch their legs City Suitability: Would not do well in a busy city. She’s easily spooked by noises and prefers a calm, slow-paced environment. She’d be perfect for someone in the suburbs or countryside. Potty Training: She’s potty trained to go outside during yard breaks but also uses wee pads inside her playpen if needed. Strangers: Shy at first, but very food motivated. Positive reinforcement goes a long way with her — treats help her open up quickly. Other Dogs: She’s okay with calm dogs who keep to themselves after the initial sniff. She’s not playful or social with other dogs and generally prefers her own space. Kids: Okay with respectful adults. Young kids could scare her. Cats: Yes. Seniors are usually mellow enough that they are able to coexist well with cats. Mouthy Behavior: None. She has no interest in chewing or grabbing anything she’s not supposed to. Separation: Fine being left alone. She mostly naps or relaxes quietly. Leash Skills: Not good on leash. She prefers being off-leash in a secure yard and doesn’t enjoy going for walks on a leash. Cuddles: She’s not clingy, but she likes being around people she trusts. Not a lap dog, but will lie nearby. Crate: She uses her crate when she wants quiet time. No issues with crating when needed. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm negative; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake. Adopters will need to be ready for senior care – at a minimum, that will be annual checkups including senior bloodwork and a dental post adoption (most senior rescues need one).

Thier Foster Parent Says: \"Rosco truly is a sweet, charming dog who just needs time & patience to warm!He’s a little wary of new people/strangers, but he seems to warm up quite quickly to his human parent once he realizes that you’ll be his caretaker. Once he loves you, there’s no end to it—he’ll follow you around everywhere, including to the bathroom as you shower, and he loves giving your pillow a good old face rub first thing in the morning when you’re out of bed. He seems to do well with other dogs (inside the house) and even with cats! He’s quite easy to take care of in my opinion. He doesn’t seem to overeat during meal times, so you can leave food out for him to free feed himself throughout the day as needed. & he’s a snoozer in the morning, so he’ll wake up whenever you do, which means you don’t have to worry about 5 am wake up calls to use the bathroom. He’s down to play whenever and does the cutest begging motion with his paws to indicate playtime, but he’s also down to chill and rest. He loves to walk regardless of weather—rain, wind, snow, shine, he wants to go out and explore the world! He can be a bit reactive on leash outside to other dogs, people and large moving vehicles, but has improved tremendously with consistent training, lots of treats (very food motivated), and a short leash!

Energy Level Medium — Not bouncing off the walls but needs long walks and playtime, likes to be active Cuddle Bug Level Medium — Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed Potty Trained Sort of — On the way and learning! may be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) Comfy with strangers? Sort of — Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. Good with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision) Not a great match for a home with kids — calm teenagers and up is okay, this pup is either mouthy and rambunctious or sensitive and requires either a low key, quiet home or a grownup only home willing do training Good with Other Dogs? Mostly — Generally good with other dogs but may be picky (scared of big dogs or plays too rough for small dogs, for example) Good with Other Animals? (cats, small pets, etc.) Nope — Really likes to chase small animals, definitely not a good match for a home with cats, rodents, etc. Mouthy Behavior? Medium – Is respectful of hands, feet, etc. but does like to chew on things it’s not supposed to like shoes, furniture, etc. Leash Manners? WTF is a Leash – Pulls hard. Zig zags like crazy. Has no idea how to walk on a leash. Okay in the city? Sort of — Spooked easily by loud noises and bustling areas but walks pretty well and probably just needs more time to adjust (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue) Jumping on People to Say Hi? High – Very excited to greet everyone and has no idea how to do so politely. Jumps up on most strangers or other dogs that go by. In puppy phase or wasn’t trained as a young adult. Separation Anxiety? Medium – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone. Crate training? Not at all – Don’t even have one, I’ve puppy proofed and we free range. Medical status Healthy as far as we know.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60 walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Thier Foster Parent Says: \" Apple is the sweetest and most lovable girl! She’s an incredibly gentle and well-behaved pup with a curious spirit. Most of the time, she’s calm and cozy.. a true snuggle bug who could spend hours cuddling and soaking up belly rubs (her all-time favorite activity!). When she gets a burst of energy, she loves playing with her squeaky toys, throwing them up in the air, and showing off her playful side. On walks, she tends to get the attention of passerby’s with her adorable face and frequent head tilts. She’s a wonderful apartment dog who is respectful, mostly quiet, and happiest when she’s close to her people. She’s also getting into a good potty routine, typically going in the morning and improving every day as she adjusts to her schedule. She even enjoys her paws being cleaned with her doggy wipes when she gets back into the apartment (she treats it like she’s at the spa!). Apple is the perfect mix of affectionate, mellow, and curious, and will make an awesome companion in her forever home!\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. TOLERANCE TO CITY City pup – Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS In between bean – Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines *** she will pull towards some other dogs because she wants to say hi but is very easy to redirect and keep walking. She can also be unfazed as well. We have only allowed her to socialize in very quick on-the-go interactions but seems good with other dogs. Used to live with other dogs - okay to be in a home with another dog :) RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Okay to be in a home with cats - we don't forsee this being an issue and she came from a home with cats MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Past this stage– Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in their mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Past this stage – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or exhibit destructive behavior when you leave the apartment or house. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Calm Greetings – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night. *** we left her in the crate when we were at work for the first few days and she would walk into it when we pointed at it without using any words. She seems to be used to it and falls asleep but she is very good so we don’t put her in the crate anymore. She sleeps in her dog bed in our room at night, not in the crate. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Recovering from an ear infection - common for the breed mix.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Their Foster Parent Says: \" Steve loves people and dogs and chasing after squirrels and birds. Every time we pass a person or a dog, he is always wagging his tail and pulling his leash to greet them. As soon as someone gives him affection, he literally slides down and rolls over on his back for belly rubs. He is such a trusting and sweet dog. In the morning, he waits patiently for me in the bathroom while I get ready and will sit or lay down on my bath mat (since I have towels everywhere on the floor to protect my white carpets, he thinks any towel is for him) then we go for a 45 minute walk, come home and he eats his breakfast, depending on how tired he is from his walk, he will typically play on his own for an hour before taking a 4 hour nap. We then go for a potty break, play a little more and then another 45 minute walk in the evening followed by dinner, more play time and a final night potty. He is definitely teething right now and is a little mouthy which is understandable for a pup his age. He loves playing fetch, gnawing on his toys and is very food motivated. As a typical lab, he scarfs down his food in 5 minutes even with a slow feeder. He needs leash training as he pulls very hard during our walks when he sees a bird, squirrel or dog which is often as you can imagine in NYC. He is a little afraid of bikes, buses and leaf blowers and will pull the leash to move away from them and gets down low. However he is pretty tolerable of the city life and will adjust quickly. He’s very comfortable in elevators, with stairs and riding the subway which is impressive coming from South Carolina. The best part about this pup, is he practically came potty trained and crate trained and has had no accidents thus far! The best pup of the 7 I’ve fostered thus far.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each).

(This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) City pup Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Social butterfly – Wants to be friends with everyone who walks by, loves anyone who will stop to say hello. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Maybe for age 12 and up – Is either big and energetic (okay with kids big enough not to get knocked down) or a little skittish (could be comfortable with older children that can be extra gentle) SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc. Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Needs training – Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained. Tries to put their mouth on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs leash, chews on your personal belongings SEPARATION ANXIETY ( Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. LEASH MANNERS WTF is a leash – Pulls hard. Zig zags like crazy. Has no idea how to walk on a leash or doesn’t have outside privileges yet (too young) CUDDLE BUG LEVEL Medium – Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Needs training – Very excited to greet everyone and has no idea how to do so politely. Jumps up on most strangers or other dogs that go by. In puppy phase or wasn’t trained as a young adult.

She is extremely food motivated, and loves any kind of meat, carrots, bananas, and peanut butter treats. Freya has met a couple of other dogs and gets along, but is timid at first and hangs back when there is a lot of activity happening.

He is a showstopper on the streets rocking his silky coat and middle part. He is pretty unphased by city life and loves to go for a long walk or accompany you on your errands. He enjoys saying hello to other dogs on the street and will try to jump up and say hi to strangers at times. He is quickly getting the hang of leash walking and does all his business outside- in a day or two he’ll be a pro at the leash. He is extremely affectionate and will climb into your lap gently for cuddles and lick your whole face clean. He loves to be pet, but prefers to find a cozy spot on the carpet or dog bed to nap. At home he will play with his toys on his own or occupy himself with a chew, while keeping a close eye on you. It honestly doesn’t get more perfect than this southern gentleman.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day.

      "description": "1 year, 25lbs, Beagle Mix, Spayed IMPORTANT NOTE: Shiloh can not live in the city. This pup needs an out of ciy home - burbs and beyond! This dog is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Their Foster Parents Say: \"Shiloh was very shy for the first week or so but we let her take her time and get to know her surroundings. Once she started coming out and interacting with the household she was a completely different dog. She needs some extra love and patience as she is pretty scared of most new things. Little kids, parking lots, moving vehicles, and loud noises invoke big feelings for her so she will need lots and lots of positive reinforcement. She's a very smart girl and picks up on everything she sees and hears. She will need lots of stimulation like long chews, puzzles, long walks in nature, and sniffing games in the grass. We like to do early walks in the morning and various backyard play and potty breaks throughout the day. She usually will sleep pretty well during the daytime if she gets a good, stimulating walk in the morning. In the afternoon a good long chew keeps her occupied for a while. I have been doing her meals in a sniffy mat so she doesn't gobble it down too quickly and she gets to have an activity at the same time. Even though she has her few quirks, once she is comfortable Shiloh is a pretty easy dog. She really wants to cuddle with our beagles but they're too grumpy for a young pup. She plays really well with our little girl beagle too. She would do well in a house where there is another young dog who likes to play with others, or a patient buddy who will let her cuddle.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle Bug Level Medium — Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed Potty Trained Yes — Knows to go on command. Needs a handful of potty breaks. Comfy with strangers? Takes Time to Warm Up — It just takes her a day or so to warm up to new people. She is still very apprehensive/scared when encountering new people. But once she is comfortable she is a very playful and silly girl. Good with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision) Not a great match for a home with kids -- calm teenagers and up is okay. Shiloh is very scared of little kids, particularly the loud noises they make. Good with Other Dogs? Yes — Shiloh has done well with our two beagles and is anxious to play. On walks/on leash she is nervous and skittish around other dogs. She would do well with another young, medium/small dog or a dog who will let her cuddle with them. Good with Other Animals? (cats, small pets, etc.) Not sure if good with cats — we can cat test for approved adopters Mouthy Behavior? Respectful – She enjoys chewing on bones, antlers, and hooves but is good about not chewing on people items. Leash Manners? Getting the Hang of it – She is pretty nose driven and will pull for a sent and she will pull ahead when there are people or dogs in view, but she does pretty well on leash otherwise if the area is quiet (no cars, people, dogs). We have mostly been doing hikes with her and down our dead end street. Okay in the city? Nope — Needs a suburban home Jumping on People to Say Hi? Low – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. Separation Anxiety? Nope – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or do anything shitty when you leave the apartment or house. Crate training? Yep – Shiloh is fine with using a crate. Her previous foster used one but her current foster doesn't use one. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Thier Foster Parent Says: \" Tink is a very sweet girl. She’s the biggest cuddle bug and definitely thinks she’s a lap dog. She’s a good sleeper throughout the night and just stays in the bed with you until you get it. So no waking you up in the morning. She loves her morning walks in the park and saying hi to everyone she can. Silly girl does like to eat things off the ground so got to watch out for that but good news she will let you grab whatever she’s eating out of mouth without a fight. She is not food aggressive in any way. I don’t think she knows any commands but does understand the word no. Sadly she does not play with any toys! She doesn’t know what to do with them! Maybe it’s something she will learn in time. Safe to say she doesn’t tear anything up though, all your shoes and furniture are safe. She if the biggest lover girl and will be attached to your side.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day.

(This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle bug level? EXTRA CUDDLY, wants to be in the lap at all times Potty trained? yes, had accident very first day but understandable she was adjusting! No more since then Comfy with strangers? Yes! She LOVES people and wants to say hi to everyone, gentle girl Comfortable with children? not sure, she’s not jumpy with it comes to people and wags her tail when walking past kids but so far no interaction Social with other dogs? needs some work, gets extremely excited and cries/jumps towards all dogs. I wouldn’t say unfriendly but needs to learn some manners. I think other dogs are unsure of her excitement. We need to have longer interactions so see how she is Respectful of other animals? she’s currently in a home with 3 cats. So far good but has a tendency to want to chase when they run fast. 1/10 times she will react towards them. Most of the down she just lays on the couch and ignores them. Maybe a house with one dominant cat would be ok! Mouthy behavior? soooo quiet does not bark at all, maybe heard her bark twice, unless wanting to meet other dogs! Leash manners? she pulls in the beginning, a little zig zaggy but after 15 minutes or so she’s walks along side of you Okay in the city? she prefers a quieter area with more space(currently in ridgewood) she has been in the city but gets overstimulated with all the people and dogs so close Jumping on people to say hi? not really, if you are sitting she wants to prop herself on you Separation anxiety? so far no crying just sleeps on the couch Crate no crate Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm negative; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Puerto Rico or Southern California. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them.

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Our Team Says: \" He's a big ladies man!! Loves ladies - more nervous around men - would be good for a couple but might have a hard time with a single man.\" Thier Foster Parent Says: \"Hank is a very shy/nervous boy but once he warms up to you, he will become your bestfriend and a major cuddle bug. He loves to sprawl on the couch and play with his toys or chew on his bone. When he's not playing, he'll come right up to you for some snuggles (he's a great nap partner). Though he gets spooked by people outside, he is very calm indoors and most loud noises don't phase him (minus the vacuum). He is also the most quiet, gentle, and sweet soul. He may not know many commands, but he does understand the important ones - \"no\" and \"drop it\". He is smart and a fast learner so I'm sure he'll know plenty more in no time.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) ENERGY LEVEL Medium – Needs a daily 60-90 minute morning walk or window of quick paced exercise in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant opportunities to socialize outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) TOLERANCE TO CITY Adjusting to the city – Spooked easily by loud noises and bustling areas but walks pretty well in quiet areas and probably just needs more time to adjust (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue). Would prefer a home in a calmer part of the city or the suburbs. POTTY TRAINING Sort of -- On the way and learning! May be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Wallflower – Very shy with new people and takes a while to warm up. Afraid when unfamiliar people try to say hi on the street, hides or shrinks back when new people visit the home. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Maybe for age 12 and up – Is either big and energetic (okay with kids big enough not to get knocked down) or a little skittish (could be comfortable with older children that can be extra gentle) SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Still working on it – Either retreats from other dogs or barks at them/leash reactive. Needs more socialization training or may just be a dog that prefers human company RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Working on it – Is respectful of hands, feet, etc. but likes to chew on things they’re not supposed to like shoes, furniture, etc. SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL Medium – Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Calm Greetings – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night. (does not do well in crate when left alone, but loves it when you're home) Medical status Healthy as far as we know.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Their Foster Parent Says: \" Ted is a very sweet and very shy boy, but he is getting braver and opening up more and more every day. He does great in all kinds of public situations and will accompany you on your walk to the coffee shop or to a fun weekend brunch spot, where he expects at least 4 french fries. He is very treat-motivated but is polite with his meals and likes to graze throughout the day. Napping on the sofa or at your feet while you work is his main daytime activity. He also loves chewing on his stick and gazing out the window. He is very curious about what the people are up to and will follow to observe you (just in case you're getting a treat). Ted would love a backyard that he can freely explore and hang out in when the weather is nice, but he also loves wandering around the city, so it's not a must. Ted is very patient and doesn't mind when you leave; he will curl up and snooze or stare out the window while you're away. He is still very shy with other dogs in public but seems to open up and like them when they are in the apartment, so a companion for him would be nice! He is still very nervous when being picked up in public, so it's best to travel with a carrier if going on the subway. He will require meds 3x a day for his heart but usually eats it with no complaints with a pill pocket or piece of Parmesan. Ted is such a sweetheart, and his quirks are to be expected for a dog that has never lived in a home, but he is adapting very quickly and would make an excellent companion for someone living a slower pace of life.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Medical status Ted has pulmonary hypertension - a side effect of being treated for heartworm. Requires daily medication and annual monitoring. He ended up in the ER for a few days a few months ago but has been doing really well on his medication once we were able to find out exactly what was going on!

      "description": "LADY GAGA - 10 years, 9lbs, Chi Mix, Spayed Please Note: This dog will do best in a home in a calm area or the burbs. Not the biggest fan of the city. This dog is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Thier Foster Parent Says: \"She never answered to lady Gaga and we’ve been calling her Abby for the last five months. She responded to baby and it just kind of evolved from there. Lady Gaga is the funniest girl. She’s smart, vocal, dramatic and is very food motivated. To her, all food is considered fair game. While she’s not the most confident walker, she’s pee pad trained, although she does still have the occasional accident. We are working on getting her more comfortable on walks but it’s a good idea to always have a pee pad handy as she likes to get up in the middle of the night to do her business. She’s friendly with cats and is comfortable around small groups of adults. She’s super sensitive to being by picked up and is easily overwhelmed by a lot of energy. She would be be suited for a home with adults without children. She’s a bit of a Velcro dog, she likes to know where her people are at all times and really loves to sleep on the bed. She loves toys and treats and has the energy of a much younger dog. Her favorite thing in the world (besides treats!) is snuggling under a blanket, she loves toys to burrow and can be a little hard to find sometimes. As far as her athleticism goes, she can jump surprisingly high and make it on top of a bed pretty easily. If you’re looking for a little dog with a big personality and a lot of love to give, Lady Gaga is the pup for you. She requires a lot of attention and can be very vocal when she feels as if that quota isn’t being met but she makes up for it by being cuddly (on her terms!) and sweet.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: FLEXIBLE: We predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale with regard to exercise and mental stimulation requirements, but seniors tend to need a lot of help and understanding when it comes to lifestyle and veterinary issues. Seniors usually need quiet, calm environments and routines and do not do well with a lot of bustle, change, and rambunctious movement (kids and young playful dogs, for instance). This dog’s adopter will need to be prepared for senior health challenges, which usually come with expensive veterinary bills and time in vet offices. Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless amounts of stimulation and exercise but still needs a few short walks a day (10-30 min each) for potty breaks and to stretch their legs Cuddle Bug Level Medium - Loves affection but doesn't need to be on top of you Potty Trained Yes: does a combo of pee pads and going outside. Would probably have a much easier time with potty stuff if she was out of the city and had a yard. Comfy with Strangers Sort Of: She’s super friendly but tentative at first but loves getting pets from anyone once she’s sniffed a little! Good with children? Nope - Nott a great match for a home w/ kids: She is really sensitive and if isn’t touched the right way freaks out. She will also sometimes panic if she near someone’s foot while walking. She will run and hide and yelp when she isn’t pet in the exact right spots and needs to be picked up very specifically. Good with other dogs? Yes - Amazing with small dogs under 20lbs! A little tentative when she sees bigger ones. Would do great in a home with a dog that is chill like her . Good with other animals? Yes: Her and my cats are just very chill. Mouthy behavior? Nope - past this stage of life Leash manners? Getting the hang of it Okay in the city? Sort of: She isn’t a bad walker but she’s clearly not into the hustle and bustle. I’ve only ever seen her use the bathroom on walks in a more suburban environment. Jumping on people to say hi? Low - good at keeping all 4 on the floor Separation anxiety? Nope: She tends to do her business when I leave and will also find a blanket or pile of clothes to hide in once I’m back. Crate training? Not at all Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm negative; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake. Adopters will need to be ready for senior care – at a minimum, that will be annual checkups including senior bloodwork and a dental post adoption (most senior rescues need one). How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

      "description": "FRANCIS - 8 months & 10lbs (as of 10/14), Chi Mix, Spayed Estimated to Be About 15lbs Full Grown This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Our Team Says: \"Francis needs a home in a calm area. She's not fully a city girl. Calm areas and beyond are best for this girl!\" Thier Foster Parents Says: \"Francis is a sweet, silly and rambunctious gal who is very shy at first but really bursts out of her shell once she’s comfortable. She’s curious about the world around her and is always the first one to investigate new items at home (she is not this brave out in the wild). Fran loves to play hard but loves to nap just as much! Fran loves a good sunbathing moment and will always look for a sunny spot around the house to bask in. She loves going on walks especially with her K9 foster brother (her preferred company), but is very hesitant to do her business in new places, the slower the pace the better. Though she is a very friendly pup, she shies away from strangers out in public, she prefers slow meet and greets. She’s a big cuddle bug, and loves behind the ear scratches. Francis loves following her human around when they're home, on my work from home days she can be found hanging out in my study with her foster brother or napping by my feet while I take a meeting. True to her inner chihuahua nature, this small gal has a small but mighty bark, especially when she gets spooked, she’s not a fan of surprises or loud noises. Fran can be a little stubborn (especially when it involves an early morning wake up) but overall, is a very good girl!\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle Bug Level Medium — Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed Potty Trained Sort of — On the way and learning! may be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) Comfy with strangers? Nope — Quite the wallflower, very shy with new people and takes a while to warm up. Afraid when unfamiliar people try to say hi on the street, hides or shrinks back when new people visit the home. Good with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision) Yes for 12 and up — may be a little energetic or a little skittish, best with older children that can be extra gentle or that are big enough not to get accidentally knocked down Good with Other Dogs? Mostly — Generally good with other dogs but may be picky (scared of big dogs or plays too rough for small dogs, for example) Good with Other Animals? (cats, small pets, etc.) Francis is still too unsure of the world around to notice the birds and squirrels she encounters on her walks. Mouthy Behavior? Low – Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in its mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime, doesn’t wreck your stuff — only chews on appropriate things like dog toys and bones. Leash Manners? Getting the Hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in its life but he/she is figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. Okay in the city? Nope — Needs a home out of the city! Jumping on People to Say Hi? Medium – Jumps up only on people the dog knows when really excited. Stops with correction. Separation Anxiety? Medium – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone. Crate training? Not at all – Don’t even have one, I’ve puppy proofed and we free range. Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas.

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless amounts of stimulation and exercise. But still needs a solid adventure walk (30 to 60 minutes) in addition to potty breaks. Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Thier Foster Parent Says: \" Ladybug is a 10-year-old Chihuahua mix with the sweetest, softest soul. She’s quiet, gentle, and happiest when she’s curled up next to you or snoozing under a blanket. She loves affection and will happily sleep in bed with you if invited. She came to NYC from Tennessee and is still adjusting to busy sidewalks and city sounds, so she needs someone patient who can let her go at her own pace. Each day she’s showing little improvements, and I can see her confidence slowly growing. She’s timid but friendly with adults, and while we haven’t fully tested her with other dogs or cats, she’s remained calm and uninterested when passing dogs outside.Ladybug would be a wonderful companion for someone looking for a low-energy, cuddle-loving dog. With time, stability, and kindness, I think she’ll continue to open up and show even more of her personality. She’s a lovely, gentle girl who just wants to feel safe and loved.\" Level of dog ownership experience needed: FLEXIBLE: We predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale with regard to exercise and mental stimulation requirements, but seniors tend to need a lot of help and understanding when it comes to lifestyle and veterinary issues. Seniors usually need quiet, calm environments and routines and do not do well with a lot of bustle, change, and rambunctious movement (kids and young playful dogs, for instance). This dog’s adopter will need to be prepared for senior health challenges, which usually come with expensive veterinary bills and time in vet offices. Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless exercise. TOLERANCE TO CITY Adjusting to the city – Spooked easily by loud noises and bustling areas but walks pretty well in quiet areas and probably just needs more time to adjust (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue). Would prefer a home in a calmer part of the city or the suburbs. POTTY TRAINING Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Wallflower – Very shy with new people and takes a while to warm up. Afraid when unfamiliar people try to say hi on the street, hides or shrinks back when new people visit the home. This could change overtime as she gains confidence in the city/her new environment BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Maybe for age 12 and up – Is either big and energetic (okay with kids big enough not to get knocked down) or a little skittish (could be comfortable with older children that can be extra gentle) SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Still working on it – Either retreats from other dogs or barks at them/leash reactive. Needs more socialization training or may just be a dog that prefers human company No barking, just has seemed mostly disinterested so far. Haven’t had a ton of socialization opportunities yes other than passing dogs on the street RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Yes – Seems to get along with cats etc., either tries to play with them or is mostly uninterested Haven’t had interactions with cats, but based on her demeanor so far, she would likely be fine MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Past this stage– Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in their mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Past this stage – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or exhibit destructive behavior when you leave the apartment or house. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Calm Greetings – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. CRATE TRAINING Not at all – Don’t even have one, I’ve puppy proofed and we free range. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake.

(This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) POTTY TRAINED? Working on this skill. Puppies under 12 weeks old are often on track with their wee pad skills, but they’re too young to walk outside in public NYC areas yet because they haven’t finished their puppy vaccine series. Puppies older than 12 weeks are usually learning to do their business outside. Potty training takes a lot of patience, consistency, and clean up. SOCIAL WITH DOGS? Yes. Some puppies are shy, others are bold, but all have the potential to be taught healthy socializing skills. It’s a huge part of raising a puppy and must be done carefully. How they interact with other dogs depends largely on how their humans help them learn to. SOCIAL WITH CHILDREN? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) Yes… but most puppies are not a great match for a home with kids under age 8 because they go through intense mouthy play and rambunctious phases and often accidentally hurt young kids while playing. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. SOCIAL WITH CATS? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. MOUTHY PLAY: High! All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. SEPARATION ANXIETY MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. LEASH MANNERS: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. CRATE TRAINED: Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know.

Some puppies are shy, others are bold, but all have the potential to be taught healthy socializing skills. It’s a huge part of raising a puppy and must be done carefully. How they interact with other dogs depends largely on how their humans help them learn to. SOCIAL WITH CHILDREN? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) Yes… but most puppies are not a great match for a home with kids under age 8 because they go through intense mouthy play and rambunctious phases and often accidentally hurt young kids while playing. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. SOCIAL WITH CATS? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. MOUTHY PLAY: High! All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. SEPARATION ANXIETY MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. LEASH MANNERS: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. CRATE TRAINED: Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon HOW DID THIS DOG END UP WITH US? Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day.

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless amounts of stimulation and exercise. But still needs a solid adventure walk (30 to 60 minutes) in addition to potty breaks. Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Potty trained? Working on this skill. Puppies under 12 weeks old are often on track with their wee pad skills, but they’re too young to walk outside in public NYC areas yet because they haven’t finished their puppy vaccine series. Puppies older than 12 weeks are usually learning to do their business outside. Potty training takes a lot of patience, consistency, and clean up. Crate trained? Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. Social with dogs? Yes. Some puppies are shy, others are bold, but all have the potential to be taught healthy socializing skills. It’s a huge part of raising a puppy and must be done carefully. How they interact with other dogs depends largely on how their humans help them learn to. Social with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) Yes… but most puppies are not a great match for a home with kids under age 8 because they go through intense mouthy play and rambunctious phases and often accidentally hurt young kids while playing. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Social with cats? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. Mouthy play: High! All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. Leash manners: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. Separation anxiety: MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas.

Our Team Says: \"We rarely have cats up for adoption these days, but Jazmin was adopted from our organization almost a decade ago and her owner recently passed away, so she’s back in our care. This 8-year-old girl is the kind of feline that would turn people who don’t “get” cats — she’s easy going, friendly, affectionate, does transitions easily, acts like a dog. She’s also quite fat and a bit chatty — like Garfield’s gray tortie cousin. She’s been fine home alone so would be good as a solo pet. Not sure how she is in a home with other animals.\" Thier Foster Parent Says: \" Jazmin is a very loving cat who enjoys chilling on the couch or snuggling next to someone. She is a very talkative cat, but she is also the gentlest and sweetest cat ever. She is already potty trained and has had no problems, even on the first day of fostering. She does not play much, but that could be due to not finding her the right toy.\" PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old).
