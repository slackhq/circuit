Changelog
=========

0.3.0
-----

_2022-11-01_

* **New**: The Overlay API is now extracted to a separate, optional `circuit-overlay` artifact.
* **New**: The `circuit-core` artifact now packages in baseline profiles.
* **Enhancement**: Simplify backstack root pop handling. There is no more `onRootPop()` option in `rememberCircuitNavigator()`, instead you should install your own `BackHandler()` prior to rendering your circuit content to customize back behavior when the circuit `Navigator` is at root.
* **Fix**: `circuit-codegen-annotations` is now a multiplatform project and doesn't accidentally impose the compose-desktop dependency.

We've also updated a number of docs around code gen, overlays, and interop (including a new interop sample).

0.2.0
-----

_2022-10-26_

- **New**: Code gen artifact. This targets specifically using Dagger + Anvil and will generate `Presenter` and `Ui.Factory` implementations for you. See `CircuitInject` for more details.
  ```kotlin
  ksp("com.slack.circuit:circuit-codegen:x.y.z")
  implementation("com.slack.circuit:circuit-codegen-annotations:x.y.z")
  ```

- **New**: There is now an `EventListener` API for instrumenting state changes for a given `Screen`. See its docs for more details.
- **Fix**: Rework `rememberRetained` implementation and support for multiple variables. Previously it only worked with one variable.
- **Fix**: Clean up some unnecessary transitive dependencies in misc artifacts.
