/**
 * Represents a composable UI for the given [UiState]. Conventionally, this should just be the
 * return type of a ui function and a thin shim over a "real" implementation.
 *
 * This has two main benefits:
 * 1. Discouraging properties and general non-composable state that writing a class may invite.
 * 2. Ensuring separation of [Ui] instance from [Screen] specific ui composables allows for and
 * encourages easy UI previews via Compose's `@Preview` annotations.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * internal fun tacoUi(): Ui<State> = ui { state ->
 *   Tacos(state)
 * }
 *
 * @Composable private fun Tacos(state: State) {...}
 *
 * @Preview
 * @Composable
 * private fun PreviewTacos() = Tacos(...)
 * ```
 *
 * This could be a class, but isn't necessary unless you're using dependency injection. Most UIs
 * don't use dependency injection at all however, unless maybe getting assisted injections of things
 * like image loaders.
 *
 * If a given [Presenter] only ever emits the same state, you can define a single value-less
 * `object` type for the state.
 *
 * Note that due to a bug in studio, we can't make this a `fun interface` _yet_. Instead, use [ui].
 *
 * @see ui
