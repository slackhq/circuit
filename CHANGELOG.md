**Unreleased**
--------------

### Navigation with results

This release introduces support for inter-screen navigation results. This is useful for scenarios where you want to pass data back to the previous screen after a navigation event, such as when a user selects an item from a list and you want to pass the selected item back to the previous screen.

```kotlin
var photoUrl by remember { mutableStateOf<String?>(null) }
val takePhotoNavigator = rememberAnsweringNavigator<TakePhotoScreen.Result>(navigator) { result ->
  photoUrl = result.url
}

// Elsewhere
takePhotoNavigator.goTo(TakePhotoScreen)

// In TakePhotoScreen.kt
data object TakePhotoScreen : Screen {
  @Parcelize
  data class Result(val url: String) : PopResult
}

class TakePhotoPresenter {
  @Composable fun present(): State {
    // ...
    navigator.pop(result = TakePhotoScreen.Result(newFilters))
  }
}
```

See the [new section in the navigation docs](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/navigation/#results) for more details, as well as [updates to the Overlays](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/overlays/overlays/#overlay-vs-popresult) docs that help explain when to use an `Overlay` vs navigating to a `Screen` with a result.

### Support for multiple back stacks

This release introduces support for saving/restoring navigation state on root resets (aka multi back stack). This is useful for scenarios where you want to reset the back stack to a new root but still want to retain the previous back stack's state, such as an app UI that has a persistent bottom navigation bar with different back stacks for each tab.

This works by adding two new optional `saveState` and `restoreState` parameters to `Navigator.resetRoot()`.

```kotlin
navigator.resetRoot(HomeNavTab1, saveState = true, restoreState = true)
// User navigates to a details screen
navigator.push(EntityDetails(id = foo))
// Later, user clicks on a bottom navigation item
navigator.resetRoot(HomeNavTab2, saveState = true, restoreState = true)
// Later, user switches back to the first navigation item
navigator.resetRoot(HomeNavTab1, saveState = true, restoreState = true)
// The existing back stack is restored, and EntityDetails(id = foo) will be top of
// the back stack
```

There are times when saving and restoring the back stack may not be appropriate, so use this feature only when it makes sense. A common example where it probably does not make sense is launching screens which define a UX flow which has a defined completion, such as onboarding.

### New Tutorial!

On top of Circuit's existing docs, we've added a new tutorial to help you get started with Circuit. It's a step-by-step guide that walks you through building a simple inbox app using Circuit, intended to serve as a sort of small code lab that one could do in 1-2 hours. Check it out [here](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/tutorial/).

### Overlay Improvements

- **New**: Promote `AlertDialogOverlay`, `BasicAlertDialogOverlay`, and `BasicDialogOverlay` to `circuitx-overlay`.
- **New**: Add `OverlayEffect` to `circuit-overlay`. This offers a simple composable effect to show an overlay and await a result.
  ```kotlin
  OverlayEffect(state) { host ->
    val result = host.show(AlertDialogOverlay(...))
    // Do something with the result
  }
  ```
- Add `OverlayState` and `LocalOverlayState` to `circuit-overlay`. This allows you to check the current overlay state (`UNAVAILABLE`, `HIDDEN`, or `SHOWING`).
- Mark `OverlayHost` as `@ReadOnlyOverlayApi` to indicate that it's not intended for direct implementation by consumers.
- Mark `Overlay` as `@Stable`.

### Misc

- Make `NavEvent.screen` public.
- Change `Navigator.popUntil` to be exclusive.
- Add `Navigator.peek()` to peek the top screen of the back stack.
- Add `Navigator.peekBackStack()` to peek the top screen of the back stack.

- Refreshed iOS Counter sample using SPM and SKIE.
- Convert STAR sample to KMP. Starting with Android and Desktop.
- Fix baseline profiles packaging. Due to a bug in the baseline profile plugin, we were not packaging the baseline profiles in the artifacts. This is now fixed.
- Mark `BackStack.Record` as `@Stable`.
- Fix an infinite loop in the `onRootPop` of the Android `rememberCircuitNavigator`.
- Update the default decoration to better match the android 34 transitions.
- Update androidx.lifecycle to `2.7.0`.
- Update to compose multiplatform to `1.5.12`.
- Update compose-compiler to `1.5.8`.

dependencies {
  implementation("com.slack.circuit:circuitx-effects:<version>")
}
```

Docs: https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/circuitx/#effects

0.15.0
------

_2023-09-20_

### **New**: Allow retained state to be retained whilst UIs and Presenters are on the back stack.

Originally, `circuit-retained` was implemented as a solution for preserving arbitrary data across configuration changes on Android. With this change it now also acts as a solution for retaining state _across the back stack_, meaning that traversing the backstack no longer causes restored contents to re-run through their empty states anymore.

To support this, each back stack entry now has its own `RetainedStateRegistry` instance.

Note that `circuit-retained` is still optional for now, but we are considering making it part of `CircuitCompositionLocals` in the future. Please let us know your thoughts in this issue: https://github.com/slackhq/circuit/issues/891.

Full details + demos can be found in https://github.com/slackhq/circuit/pull/888. Big thank you to [@chrisbanes](https://github.com/chrisbanes) for the implementation!

### Other changes

- **New**: Add `collectAsRetainedState` utility function, analogous to `collectAsState` but will retain the previous value across configuration changes and back stack entries.
- **Enhancement**: Optimize `rememberRetained` with a port of the analogous optimization in `rememberSaveable`. See [#850](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit/pull/850).
- **Enhancement**: `Presenter` and `Ui` interfaces are now annotated as `@Stable`.
- **Fix**: Fix `GestureNavigationDecoration` function parameter order.
- **Fix**: `BackHandler` on iOS now has the proper file name.
- **Fix**: Key the `presenter.present()` in `CircuitContent` on the `Screen` rather than the `presenter` itself, which fixes a severe issue that prevented `currentCompositeKeyHash` from working correctly on `rememberRetained` and `rememberSaveable` uses.
- Update CM compiler to `1.5.2`.
- Update CM to `1.5.1`.
- Update `androidx.compose.animation` to `1.5.1`.
- Update `androidx.compose.foundation` to `1.5.1`.
- Update `androidx.compose.runtime` to `1.5.1`.
- Update `androidx.compose.material` to `1.5.1`.
- Update `androidx.lifecycle` to `2.6.2`.
- Update `androidx.annotation` to `1.7.0`.

0.14.1
------

_2023-09-03_

- **New**: Add `GestureNavigationDecoration` to `CircuitX` courtesy of [@chrisbanes](https://github.com/chrisbanes).

This is a new `NavDecoration` that allows for gesture-based navigation, such as predictive back in Android 14 or drag gestures in iOS. See the [docs](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/circuitx/#gesture-navigation) for more details.

```kotlin
NavigableCircuitContent(
  navigator = navigator,
  backstack = backstack,
  decoration = GestureNavigationDecoration(
    // Pop the back stack once the user has gone 'back'
    navigator::pop
  )
)
```

- Fix embedded baseline profiles in published artifacts. Unfortunately GMDs used to generate these are quite finicky to run so these are sometimes tricky to regen each release.

0.14.0
------

_2023-08-30_

- **New**: Circuit now supports JS targets!
- **New**: Introduce CircuitX artifacts. CircuitX is a suite of extension artifacts for Circuit. These artifacts are intended to be
  batteries-included implementations of common use cases, such as out-of-the-box `Overlay` types or
  Android navigation interop. See the [docs](https://slackhq.github.io/circuit/circuitx/) for more details.
- **Enhancement**: Promote `Screen` to its own artifact. This is now under the `com.slack.circuit.runtime.screen.Screen` name.
- **Enhancement**: Use `Screen` directly in the `BackStack` in place of `route`.
- **Enhancement**: No longer require `SaveableBackStack` in `NavigableCircuitContent`, now any `BackStack` impl is supported.
- **Enhancement**: Make `CanRetainChecker` more customizable in `circuit-retained`.
- **Enhancement**: Pass the whole list of active records to `DecoratedContent`, allowing more complex handling of back gestures (predictive back in android, drag gestures in iOS, etc).
- **Enhancement**: Refactor out a `buildCircuitContentProviders()` in `NavigableCircuitContent`, which enables `movableContentOf` to work since it's reusing the same instance for records across changes.
- **Fix**: Fix duplicated `Modifier` for `DecoratedContent`.
- **Fix**: Fix new presenter instances of the same type not being recomposed. See [#799](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit/pull/799) for more details.
- **Fix**: Export iOS targets for `circuit-test` artifact.
- Demonstrate back handling for Compose Multiplatform in Counter sample.
- Add `kotlinx.collections.immutable` to core APIs.
- Update to Compile SDK 34.
- Update to Compose Multiplatform `1.5.0`.
- Update androidx.compose.compiler to `1.5.3`.
- Update androidx.compose.ui to `1.5.0`.

- Update androidx.compose.foundation to `1.5.0`.
- Update uuid to `0.8.1`.
- Update Molecule to `1.2.0`.
- Update Kotlin to `1.9.10`.
- Update KSP to `1.9.10-1.0.13`.

### Preliminary support for iOS targets

Following the announcement of Compose for iOS alpha, this release adds `ios()` and `iosSimulatorArm64()` targets for the Circuit core artifacts. Note that this support doesn't come with any extra APIs yet for iOS, just basic target support only. We're not super sure what direction we want to take with iOS, but encourage others to try it out and let us know what patterns you like. We have updated the Counter sample to include an iOS app target as well, using Circuit for the presentation layer only and SwiftUI for the UI.

Note that circuit-codegen and circuit-codegen-annotations don't support these yet, as Anvil and Dagger only support JVM targets.

More details can be found in the PR: https://github.com/slackhq/circuit/pull/583

### Misc

- Use new baseline profile plugin for generating baseline profiles.
- Misc sample app fixes and updates.
- Add window size class example to STAR sample.
- Switch to Roborazzi for screenshot test samples.
- Small documentation updates.
- Add bi-directional Flow/Circuit interop to interop sample.

Note that we unintentionally used an experimental animation API for `NavigatorDefaults.DefaultDecotration`, which may cause R8 issues if you use a newer, experimental version of Compose animation. To avoid issues, copy the animation code and use your own copy compiled against the newest animation APIs. We'll fix this after Compose 1.5.0 is released.

### Dependency updates

```
androidx.activity -> 1.7.2
compose -> 1.4.3
compose-compiler -> 1.4.7
coroutines -> 1.7.1
kotlin -> 1.8.21
kotlinpoet -> 1.13.2
turbine -> 0.13.0
```

### [Core] Split up core artifacts.
- `circuit-runtime`: common runtime components like `Screen`, `Navigator`, etc.
- `circuit-runtime-presenter`: the `Presenter` API, depends on `circuit-runtime`.
- `circuit-runtime-ui`: the `Ui` API, depends on `circuit-runtime`.
- `circuit-foundation`: the circuit foundational APIs like `CircuitConfig`, `CircuitContent`, etc. Depends on the first three.

The goal in this is to allow more granular dependencies and easier building against subsets of the API. For example, this would allow a presenter implementation to easily live in a standalone module that doesn't depend on any UI dependencies. Vice versa for UI implementations.

Where we think this could really shine is in multiplatform projects where Circuit's UI APIs may be more or less abstracted away in service of using native UI, like in iOS.

Happy groundhog day!

* **Breaking API change**: `Ui.Content()` now contains a `Modifier` parameter.

  This allows you to pass modifiers on to UIs directly.

  ```diff
   public interface Ui<UiState : CircuitUiState> {
  -  @Composable public fun Content(state: UiState)
  +  @Composable public fun Content(state: UiState, modifier: Modifier)
   }
  ```

* **New:** Add `Navigator.resetRoot(Screen)` function to reset the backstack root with a new root screen. There is a corresponding `awaitResetRoot()` function added to `FakeNavigator`.
* **New:** Add `EventListener.start` callback function.
* **New:** Add Compose UI dependency to circuit-core (to support `Modifier` in the API).
* **Fix:** Fix `CircuitContext.putTag` generics.
* **Fix:** Fix KSP code gen artifact to just be a pure JVM artifact.
* **Fix:** `EventListener.onState`'s type is now `CircuitUiState` instead of `Any`.
* **Removed:** `ScreenUi` is now removed and `Ui.Factory` simply returns `Ui` instances now.
* **API Change:** `CircuitConfig.onUnavailableContent` is now no longer nullable. By default it displays a big ugly error text. If you want the previous behavior of erroring, replace it with a composable function that just throws an exception.

* Dependency updates
```
Kotlin 1.8.0
Compose-JB 1.3.0
KSP 1.8.0-1.0.9
Compose Runtime 1.3.3
Compose UI 1.3.3
Compose Animation 1.3.3
```

0.5.0

* **Enhancement**: Circuit no longer requires manual provisioning of its internal backing `ViewModel`s. This is now done automatically by the Circuit itself.
* **Enhancement**: `circuit-retained` is now fully optional and not included as a transitive dependency of circuit-core. If you want to use it, see its installation instructions in its [README](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit/tree/main/circuit-retained).
* **Enhancement**: Mark `Screen` as `@Immutable`.
* **Breaking API Change**: `LocalCircuitOwner` is now just `LocalCircuitConfig` to be more idiomatic.
* **Breaking API Change**: `LocalRetainedStateRegistryOwner` is now just `LocalRetainedStateRegistry` to be more idiomatic.
* **Breaking API Change**: `Continuity` is now `internal` and not publicly exposed since it no longer needs to be manually provided.
* **Breaking API Change**: `ViewModelBackStackRecordLocalProvider` is now `internal` and not publicly exposed since it no longer needs to be manually provided.
* **Fix**: Add missing license info to pom.
* Dependency updates
  ```toml

  anvil = "2.4.3"
  compose-jb = "1.2.2"
  compose-animation = "1.3.2"

  ```

0.4.0
-----

_2022-12-07_

* **Breaking API Change**: `Presenter` and `Ui` factories' `create()` functions now offer a `CircuitContext` parameter in place of a `CircuitConfig` parameter. This class contains a `CircuitConfig`, a tagging API, and access to parent contexts. This allows for plumbing your own metadata through Circuit's internals such as tracing tools, logging, etc.
* **Enhancement**: New lifecycle functions added to `EventListener`.
  * `onBeforeCreatePresenter`
  * `onAfterCreatePresenter`
  * `onBeforeCreateUi`
  * `onAfterCreateUi`
  * `onUnavailableContent`
  * `onStartPresent`
  * `onDisposePresent`
  * `onStartContent`
  * `onDisposeContent`
  * `dispose`
* Update Compose to `1.3.1`.
* Update Compose (JB) to `1.2.1`.
* Update Molecule to `0.6.1`.
* Added a demo to the STAR sample that shows how to navigate to standard Android components ([#275](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit/pull/275)).

0.3.1
-----

_2022-11-07_

* **Enhancement**: Add back the `onRootPop()` parameter in `rememberCircuitNavigator()` but use `LocalOnBackPressedDispatcherOwner` for backpress handling by default.

0.3.0
-----

_2022-11-01_

* **New**: The Overlay API is now extracted to a separate, optional `circuit-overlay` artifact.
* **New**: The `circuit-core` artifact now packages in baseline profiles.
* **Enhancement**: Simplify backstack root pop handling. There is no more `onRootPop()` option in `rememberCircuitNavigator()`, instead you should install your own `BackHandler()` prior to rendering your circuit content to customize back behavior when the circuit `Navigator` is at root.
* **Fix**: `circuit-codegen-annotations` is now a multiplatform project and doesn't accidentally impose the compose-desktop dependency.

We've also updated a number of docs around code gen, overlays, and interop (including a new interop sample).

0.2.2
-----

_2022-10-27_

- **Enhancement**: Code gen now supports non-assisted constructor-injected types.
- **Enhancement**: Code gen checks that functions and classes are visible to generated factories.

0.2.1
-----

_2022-10-27_

- **Fix**: Code gen didn't properly handle instantiating simple class types.

0.2.0
-----

_2022-10-26_

- **New**: Code gen artifact. This targets specifically using Dagger + Anvil and will generate `Presenter` and `Ui.Factory` implementations for you. See `CircuitInject` for more details.
  ```kotlin
  ksp("com.slack.circuit:circuit-codegen:x.y.z")
  implementation("com.slack.circuit:circuit-codegen-annotations:x.y.z")
  ```

- **New**: There is now an `EventListener` API for instrumenting state changes for a given `Screen`. See its docs for more details.
- **Fix**: Rework `rememberRetained` implementation and support for multiple variables. Previously it only worked with one variable.
- **Fix**: Clean up some unnecessary transitive dependencies in misc artifacts.
